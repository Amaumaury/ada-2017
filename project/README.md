# Title: A study on the civilian condition around the world

How have the civilian population been impacted by wars/conflicts for the past 35 years ?


# Abstract

Armed conflicts are still taking place nowadays around the world. Even though they usually engage military or paramilitary entities, in some region civilians are still suffering from collateral damage or direct oppression. Our goal for this project, is to analyze deeply the civilian population as a victim of wars/conflicts. Using the UCDP dataset, we will explore many dimensions from events of persecuted civilians like location, date and persecutor to gain insights on the current state of the civilian population oppression. Furthermore, by taking into account the temporal factor on the data, we will be able to analyze how is the civilian condition evolving locally and globally and how we can expect it to be for the close future.
This project clearly falls into the theme of this year “Data science for social goods” as it aims to address issues about persecuted population around the world.


# Dataset

### UCDP dataset

The UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) Global version 17.1 holds information about events of organized violence that happened during the last 35 years. It contains about 153761 entries with useful information such as the date, the region, the conflict and the number of civilian deaths.

The data is already in a reasonable format and does not require some extremely difficult preprocessing. Therefore, we will just apply basic data cleaning rules before performing our analysis.

The data size is not issue in our case as the file is only 68.5 MB when decompressed.


# Research questions

Where are civilians getting killed/oppressed the most ? In those regions, which ethnics gets killed/oppressed the most ?

Which groups kill/oppress the most civilians ?

How is civilian death/oppress rate around the world and in different regions fluctuating ?


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

1- Load the data into a dataframe

2- Clean the data

3- Begin answering some questions addressed just above


# Question for TAs

Is this project too much focused on a particular aspect ?

Is this project too simple ?
